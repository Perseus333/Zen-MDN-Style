MDN Docs is the most "official" web documentation but it's not the most visually appealing becuase of it's vast array of unnecessary features. This aims to fix that.

The priority is given to the documentation article, and everything else that doesn't facilitate the reading or navigation is removed.


- Hides header, footer and quick link sidebar
- Draws attention to the article
- Keeps the table of contents and search bar
- Moves the search bar to the right, as if it were a part of the sidebar.

Easiest way to install is through the stylus extension: https://userstyles.world/style/19906/zen-mdn-docs-developer-mozilla-org

All the code is commented out so feel free to customize it as you want.
